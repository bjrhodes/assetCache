Aims:
	Simple and fully unit-tested
	Allow for whole-direcotry includes of js / css or file-by-file includes
	should compile, minify and compress js and css into one asset each
	Should allow some way to refresh cache based on last modified dates
	should allow different pages to include different assets.
	
	
Basic flow plan:
	template file calls the loader with a list of files required
	loader parses those files, and creates a string of filenames and modified dates
		which it md5's or similar, then returns that as a filename to the template
	if that file (md5.js or md5.css) exists, job done.
	If not, do a similar check of filename and mod date against each individual
		js or css file to compare with minified versions
	foreach one that isn't there, minify and save.
	once all individual files are minified, combine into one asset.

Alternate flow:
	css/loader.php (for example) calls the script and gets the contents of the cache returned as string.
	This method for (otherwise) fully html sites.
	
In this way, we only serve one file and only re-minify files that are changed.

additional: if a js file is required but is listed as something.min.js, should always
skip minifying it.

NOTE: for initial development I'm going to use the example files supplied with HTML 
Kickstart. (Wanted to play with it anyways.) I'm also going to load the elements from
separate loader.php files to save parsing the large html file as php.

In my projects, which have a php based index, I'm likely to skip that and include a
cache-file link.
